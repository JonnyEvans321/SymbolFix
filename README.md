# SymbolFix
An Excel Add-in that uses VBA to auto-format engineering symbols.

## Backstory
Back in 2015, my friend, colleague and flatmate James Kilcran came to me with a problem. As a Mechanical Engineer, he would spend a lot of time creating detailed, well presented engineering models in Excel for clients and colleagues. A major hassle in this job was formatting all the engineering symbols. Something that Excel does not do very well.

So we both set about creating an Excel Add-in that would auto-format engineering symbols, SymbolFix. Subscripting, capitalising, correcting typos, creating greek letters, math symbols... SymbolFix does them all automatically! 

After testing on a handful of Engineers at work, SymbolFix has built up a diverse library of symbols which it will auto-format. What's more, the add-in contains a user-form that allows users to add extra engineering symbols to the library. When a user adds a symbol, it automatically gets added to a list of 'pending symbols' (if consenting, via email), meaning that there is an ever growing library of useful symbols that SymbolFix can auto-format.

## Using SymbolFix
To auto-format symbols, simply highlight the cells required, and press the SymbolFix macro.

If you have a symbol that's not in the SymbolFix library, open the userform and follow the instructions to add it in.
